## Project Name
UpPass Challenge

## Description
This app is created to show the expertise and use of an app created in VueJs.

It must show to the user a repository of books using the Google Books API, where the user can search and use filters to find books. They will be presented in a grid, with a few data, and with the option to expand it to show more information and a link to the google store for that book.

The user can also set books as favorites and check them in another view, and also delete the books from that list. For this purpose it will be used the localStorage.
